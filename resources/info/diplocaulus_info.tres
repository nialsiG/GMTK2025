info_description = "This long aquatic amphibian belongs to the extinct group of the Lepospondyls. It is famous because of its boomerang-shaped skull, which could be used  like a waterfoil. This allowed [i]Diplocaulus[/i] to rapidly ascend into the water in order to escape predators... or to ambush unwarry preys from below! During the dry season, [i]Diplocaulus[/i] used to estivate inside burrows, protected by a coccoon of mucus - just like extant lungfishes."
