info_description = "Pygocephalomorphs are an extinct group of crustaceans resembling modern crayfish. They could be found in marine, brackish and continental freshwater environments - but they thrived in swampy environments. Like some present-day crustaceans, females carried their eggs under their belly using specialized appendages called [i]oöstegites[/i]. They all went extinct at the end of the Cisuralian."
