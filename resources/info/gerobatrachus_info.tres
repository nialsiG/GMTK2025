info_description = "A putative ancestor of all extant amphibians, this small aquatic animal is known from a single nearly-complete specimen from Texas. [i]Gerobatrachus[/i] is a temnospondyl, a group of amhibians that lived for 210 millions years, from the Carboniferous to the Cretaceous - largely outliving dinosaurs! During the Permian, some temnospondyls reached very large sizes, such as the 5m long [i]Prionosuchus plummeri[/i].
