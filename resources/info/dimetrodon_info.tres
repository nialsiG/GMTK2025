info_description = "[i]Dimetrodon[/i] was a quadrupedal, sail-backed synapsid - a group of mammalian reptiles. With its deep jaw and its large serrated teeth, it was an apex predator able to hunt large terrestrial reptiles or aquatic animals such as [i]Diplocaulus[/i]. Its dorsal sail, while long thought to help regulate its body temperature, was probably used to impress rivals and to attract potential mates."
