info_description = "Although [i]Meganeuropsis[/i] looks like a dragonfly, it actually belongs to the now extinct order of the 'griffinflies' (Meganisoptera). They patrolled above open areas such as lakes or rivers, and used their barbed legs and large mandibles to capture other insects in flight. With an estimated wingspan of 71cm, [i]Meganeuropsis permiana[/i] is one of the largest insects to have roamed the sky! "
